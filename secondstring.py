# secondstring.py
# The purpose of this program is to take in text and return every second letter in reverse order.
# author: Emma Farrell

# The user is asked for some text. 
# The input function is used to request this text and take it in.
# The text is passed to the variable inputText.
# Technically, according to the Whirlwind Tour of Python book, inputText is a pointer pointing to the value, as opposed to inputText storing the value.
# But let's not get too carried away.
inputText = input("Please enter your sentence: ")

# Need to reverse the text


# Need to remove every other character.


# Output result
print()
